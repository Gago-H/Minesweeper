The game is now downloadable to play! Feel free to clone this and find the executable under Builds/Windows/Minesweeper_.exe.

Notes:

The game currently does not update the user input UI on edge cases.
e.g. Custom game --> 8x8 board with 70 mines --> game only places 63 mines but doesn't update the number in the UI.

Other than that, enjoy!
